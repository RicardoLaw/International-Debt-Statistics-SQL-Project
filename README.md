# International-Debt-Statistics

In this project we analyze a dataset using SQL

* Download the csv file.
* Import the file to MySQL
* Clean it a bit (since it's pretty clean to start with)
* Exploratory Data Analysis 


#Questions answered while analyzing this dataset: 

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
